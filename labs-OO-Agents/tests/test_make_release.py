"""Tests for the release script's capability-diff reporting.

The expensive parts of `scripts/make_release.py` (evals, builds, `gh`) cannot
run in CI, but the part that decides whether a release is safe — parsing eval
output and classifying the diff — is pure and worth pinning down. These tests
feed synthetic `.noo-eval.jsonl` through the real parser and comparator.
